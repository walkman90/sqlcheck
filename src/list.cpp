      "When you SELECT *, you're often retrieving more columns from the database than "
      "your application really needs to function. This causes more data to move from "
      "the database server to the client, slowing access and increasing load on your "
      "machines, as well as taking more time to travel across the network. This is "
      "especially true when someone adds new columns to underlying tables that didn't "
      "exist and weren't needed when the original consumers coded their data access; "
      "»Indexing issues:  "
      "Consider a scenario where you want to tune a query to a high level of performance. "
      "If you were to use *, and it returned more columns than you actually needed, "
      "the server would often have to perform more expensive methods to retrieve your "
      "data than it otherwise might. For example, you wouldn't be able to create an index "
      "which simply covered the columns in your SELECT list, and even if you did "
      "(including all columns [shudder]), the next guy who came around and added a column "
      "to the underlying table would cause the optimizer to ignore your optimized covering "
      "index, and you'd likely find that the performance of your query would drop "
      "substantially for no readily apparent reason; "
      "»Binding Problems:  "
      "When you SELECT *, it's possible to retrieve two columns of the same name from two "
      "different tables. This can often crash your data consumer. Imagine a query that joins "
      "two tables, both of which contain a column called \"ID\". How would a consumer know "
      "which was which? SELECT * can also confuse views (at least in some versions SQL Server) "
      "when underlying table structures change -- the view is not rebuilt, and the data which "
      "comes back can be nonsense. And the worst part of it is that you can take care to name "
      "your columns whatever you want, but the next guy who comes along might have no way of "
      "knowing that he has to worry about adding a column which will collide with your "
      "already-developed names.";
